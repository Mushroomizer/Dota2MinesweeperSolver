Only start or change a level when the level is completely unrevealed, else things will break.

The autoclicking is optional (And possibly frowned upon, but I mean, youre gonna click on the green tiles anyways, so why not).
Dont use the autoclicker if you are scared of being banned.
Hold Spacebar to autoclick.

Dont hold it forever, hold it to click the green tiles it has already detected, then give it a few seconds to settle down before you autoclick again, you maniac
